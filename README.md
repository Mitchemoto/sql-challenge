sql and postgresql work. 

#creating tables
if issues with table creation, please create one at a time instead of all at once. 
create tables in order shown, one at a time, and import data in same order.

#analysis
1. reviewing salary data as a whole in a query doesnt seem to be helpful. It would be best suited to find ranges of salaries within departments to find better insights
into salary data. 

2. hire dates are interesting to see when people started, and how much growth occured during the year. the data would be more informational if it included end dates for employment so you could look into tenure and find average length of employement, and then sort by department to see which have the highest retention rate. 

3. taking the name "Hercules" to sort along with the counts of last names show that this data set is likely a fake. its unlikely to have many women named hercules. the repetition of last names leads one to believe either the entire family lineage works for or has worked for the company at some point or the dataset is a fake.
